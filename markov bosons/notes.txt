A note on the physics of the cycles and its behavior as shown in the plot:
The particles on long cycles have essentially equivalent behavior to particles at 
inverse temperature k beta with k > cycle_length. Looking at the integrals of
density matrics of these particles this is directly related to the physical
origin of the convolution property of density matrices.
